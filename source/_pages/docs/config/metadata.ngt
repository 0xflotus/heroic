<h2>Configuring Metadata</h2>

<p>
  Metadata acts as the index to time series data, it is the driving force behind our <a ui-sref="^.^.filter_dsl">filter dsl</a>.

  Metadata resolution is important since it allows operators to specify a subset of known metadata, and resolve it into a set of matching time series.
  Without metadata, the burden of keeping track of time series would lie solely in the client.
